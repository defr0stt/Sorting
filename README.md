# Sorting-types
Hello everyone!

This repository consists a lot of sorting types (on current moment there are 7 types).⌚️💻💾

There are some comments in my code to make it easer to understand. 
It's my first repository what can be useful for other and for my own in the future. 

So if you have any questions or maybe you can see inaccuracies in my code please, inform me at this email : dima.sb713@gmail.com 📧
